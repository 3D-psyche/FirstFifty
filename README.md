Hi, I'm 3D-psyche,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to give you a brief info of each and every project in my First-Fifty including project goals, requirements, sources and resources.

# Overview
First Fifty is my own personal project consists 50 beginner to advanced level python projects . Also I learnt maintaning herarchy of project folders, working with git branches, git pages, and git wikis, documenting projects by README, html and jekyll etc. 

## Contact Book
- A Contact Book or a Phone Book is a GUI based application used to store, load, use and delete contacts and thier details.
- In this project you will learn working with structural databases like `sqlite` and python libraries like `Tkinter` 
- I have made this project using procedural programming but it can also be made using object oriented programming.
- Checkout of the [contactbook.md](https://github.com/3D-psyche/FirstFifty/blob/master/Contactbook/contactbook.md) file to know more abut how to run and work with python files and you can find out more about this project in [project wikis](https://github.com/3D-psyche/FirstFifty/wiki/Contact-Book)

## Hangman
- Hangman is a word guessing game. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins.  
- In this project you will use `pygame` to create the whole interface and work with functions in the backend and develop it's functionality.
- You can find out more about the game rules and code walkthorugh in [project wikis](https://github.com/3D-psyche/FirstFifty/wiki/Hangman)
