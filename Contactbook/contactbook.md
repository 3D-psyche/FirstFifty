# Tinku's GUI : The Contact Book

## Overview:
**Contact Book** is a Tinku's GUI made to simulate a pyhton phone book and is completely made using procedural programming. In this GUI you can perform viewing, deleting and updating existing contacts, adding new contacts, etc. You are also provided with a help that directs to this page which your seeing right now.

## User Manual:
First run the *contactbook.py* and you will see a window(My Contact Book) pop up as shown in figure below

You can find the view contacts, add contact and help buttons. Lets see each of them in detail.
### **_View Contacts_**:
Click the button *view contacts*, a new window(My Contacts) pops up showing the existing contacts in the contact book.

On the right side of the window, there are few buttons that you can use. They are:   
- **Add** :  
  - To add a new contact you have to click this button ( or the Add Contact button )
  - It will open a new window as shown below where you will fill in all the required details and then hit *Add Contact* button which inturn adds the contact to the contact book.
  - you can find the added contact in the list box present in the *My Contact Window*.






## Coding Process:
Let's split the process of making the Contact Book into chunks:
- main 
- view contacts
  - add contact
  - update contact
  - display contact
  - delete contact
- add new contact
- help
